# API Specs

The base URI is [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The complete list of endpoints can be found in the root folder through the `openapi.yml` file, that's the OpenAPI
specification for this application.

If you are not used to read this spec by looking at the YAML file, we recommend that you use
the [Swagger UI](https://editor-next.swagger.io/)

You can follow this steps to visualize the Open API spec file:

1. Go to https://editor-next.swagger.io/
2. Click on the _File -> Import file_ menu
3. Select the `openapi.yaml` file in the root folder
4. View the specification that was loaded in the left panel
